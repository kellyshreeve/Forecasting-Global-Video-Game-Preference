# Predicting Global Video Game Preference

A data science project that utilizes a dataset on video game platform, year of release, genre, sales, and ratings for 16715 games released between the years of 1980 to 2016. The dataset was accessed through Practicum's Data Science Bootcamp site and loaded into Jupyter Notebook for analysis using Python. The purpose of this project is to conduct data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, data visualizations, and independent samples t-tests to help predict video game sales and ratings in 2017. This project is organized into 5 parts:

1. Import and clean data for missing values and duplicates.
2. Exploratory data analysis and data visualizations of video games by year, platform, game, critic score, and genre.
3. Summary statistics by region to create regional customer profiles.
4. Hypothesis tests comparing average user ratings by platform and by genre.
5. Project conclusion and business application.
